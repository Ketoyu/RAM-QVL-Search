Small program for organizing RAM QVL (qualified vendor) lists from PC motherboard vendors. Uses Reflection to auto-generate sorts/filters.

Testing/demostration steps:

1) Open "import me.txt"

2) do a Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C (copy all) from the file

3) run the program

4) click "Fill from clipboard"

5.a) To change the sort-order, select a line in the right-hand "Sort" listbox and use the up/down arrow keys.

5.b) To select the criteria, check some of the check-boxes in the search-columns ("Vendor", "Stick size", etc.). The columns operate together in "AND", but the selections in each column operate in "OR".
	- To start out, I recommend skipping the Vendor and Chip columns.

6) Click "Run query" below the "Sort" area in order to refresh the list-view with the results.
